      <p>
        If you've ever played Minecraft, you'll notice that the world is (mostly) made up of cubes.
        It's not just Minecraft: basically every other fully destructible game (at the time of writing)
        uses cubes as the basic building block of their world.

        People often call games in this category "Voxel Games", since the word <b>voxel</b> is short for "<b>vo</b>lume <b>el</b>ement".
        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel#Computer_games">full list</a> is available on Wikipedia.
        You'll notice that all of these games make use of a three dimensional grid of cubes.
      </p>
      <AsideCard title="Technical Note">
        <p>
          A voxel is sometimes defined as "a value on a regular grid in 3D space.",
          where a <b>regular grid</b> is defined as a tessellation of parallelepipeds.
          <Citation source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel" />
          If we accept this definition, then a voxel must be a parallelepiped by definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in this article I define a voxel as a "discrete element comprising a three-dimensional entity".
          <Citation source="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voxel" />
        </p>
      </AsideCard>
      <p>
        However, in 2D games, there's a lot more variation.
        While many games use square grids, a lot of them use hexagonal grids, and even triangular ones.
      </p>
      Some notable examples of games on hex grids include:
      <ul>

      <h4>Math of grids</h4>
      <p>
        What we've been calling "grids" so far are instances of tessellations in mathematics.
      </p>
      <AsideCard title="Tessellations">
        <p>
          In math a <b>tessellation</b> is an arrangement of geometric shapes such that they fill the entire surface without any gaps or overlaps.
        </p>
        It's important to note that tessellations are a broad category. For instance:
        <ul>
          <li>The surface does not have to be Euclidean, we can tessellate hyperbolic space.</li>
          <li>We don't have to use polygons to tessellate, we can use curvy shapes.</li>
          <li>We don't have to repeat our pattern, we can mamke a tessellation which is not periodic.</li>
          <li>
            Tessellations can be in more than 2 dimensions, the cubic grid (also sometimes called the <b>cubic honeycomb</b>) is also an example of a tessellation.
            <ul>
              <li>
                In general, any tessellation made of polyhedra in more than 2 dimensions is often called a <b>honeycomb</b>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Examples of tessellations:

      Since "tessellation" is an incredibly broad category, we need to assert some properties that will help us narrow down to the most useful and easy to use subset.
      <ul>
        <li>
          We only care about tessellations in Euclidean space.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Euclidean space is what we're used to using in the real world.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's also a lot easier to code than any other space (hyperbolic, spherical, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We want to use only one type of <b>regular polygon</b> to tessellate space.
          Regular polygons are polygons like the equilateral triangle and the square, where all angles and sides have the same length.
          <ul>
            <li>Tessellations of regular polygons are periodic, which makes it easier to code for, since we can make assumptions about things like how many neighbors a block has.</li>
            <li>Tessellations of regular polygons are symmetric, which, in addition to making coding easier, makes the world look more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>
              The 3D equivalent of a regular polygon is the <b>Platonic solid</b>. It requires:
              <ul>
                <li>Each face must be a regular polygon.</li>
                <li>Each face must be congruent to the other faces.</li>
                <li>Each vertex must have the same number of faces.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              There are infinitely many regular polygons (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, etc...), but there are only 5 Platonic solids.
            </li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The category of tessellations that satisfy these conditions are called <b>regular tessellations</b>.
        The hex, triangle, and square grids all are examples of 2D regular tessellations.
        The cubic honeycomb is an example of a 3D regular tessellation.
      </p>
      <h4>Regular Tessellations in N dimensions</h4>
      <p>
        Now we get to the basic reason why video games only use the cubic honeycomb: <b>There simply aren't any other options.</b>
      </p>
      <AsideCard title="Regular Tessellations by Dimension" >

      <p>
        Inside 2 dimensions, we have our familiar square, triangular, and hexagonal tilings.
        But in 3 dimensions, we just have the cubic honeycomb.
        With the tight restrictions we specified earlier, it turns out there aren't any other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in 4D though, we have a similar situation as 2D.
        In addition to the cubic honeycomb, which appears in every dimension, we have two additional regular tessellations,
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-cell_honeycomb">16-cell honeycomb</a> and
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-cell_honeycomb">24-cell honeycomb</a>.
        These two honeycombs share another similarity with the 2D case, in that they are duals of each other.
      </p>
      <AsideCard title="Dual" >
        <p>
          In geometry, the <b>dual</b> of a tessellation is what we would get if we
          replaced the center of each polygon with a vertex and then drew a line between the vertexes if the original polygons were adjacent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's easier to understand with a visual example:
        </p>
        <div className="row my-3">
          <figure className="col text-center">
            <img alt="dual of a hexagonal grid is a triangular grid" className="d-block mx-auto" style={{ width: "15em" }} src={DualExample} />
            <figcaption>Source: Own Work</figcaption>
            <p>The dual of the hexagonal tiling is the triangular tiling, and vice-versa.</p>
          </figure>
          <figure className="col text-center">
            <img alt="square grid is self-dual" className="d-block mx-auto" style={{ width: "15em" }} src={SelfDualExample} />
            <figcaption>Source: Own Work</figcaption>
            <p>The square tiling is it's own dual. (We call the square tiling <b>self-dual</b>)</p>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </AsideCard>
      <p>
        While it's tempting to think of the 16-cell and 24-cell honeycombs as higher dimensional analogue of the triangular and hexagonal tilings respectively,
        in the same way that the 4-cubic honeycomb is a higher dimensional analogue of the square tiling, this is actually incorrect.
        The higher dimensional analogue of the triangle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cell">5-cell</a>, which can't be used to form a honeycomb in 4D.
        The <a href="">16-cell</a> is, in fact, the higher dimensional analogue of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron">octahedron</a>.
        As for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-cell">24-cell</a>, it doesn't have a Platonic solid analogue.
        (Although it does have some other analogues, as we will see later.)<Citation source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-cell" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, are there any applications of these 4D honeycombs to video games?
      </p>
      Well, not really, unless you're planning to make a 4D game, which is very cool, but pretty niche.
      Here's a list of cool 4D games.

      <h4>Space Filling Polyhedra</h4>
      <p>
        It's quite sad that we weren't able to find any regular polyhedra that can tessellate 3D space.
        However, what if we loosen the restrictions a bit?
        Let's say that we're fine with any convex polyhedron, even if it isn't regular.

            You can turn any 2D tiling of the plane into a 3D tiling by stretching it along the z axis.
            This is probably one of the easiest things to code into a game, and it's pretty practical to use.

          <h5>Rhombic Dodecahedron</h5>
          <p>
            This is honestly one of the coolest non-regular polyhedra.
            It can be constructed by splitting up a cube into 6 pyranids and flipping them inside out and reattaching them.
            Each face is an identical rhombus.

          The rhombic dodecahedron has several symmetries:
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's <b>face-transitive</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If I have a source face <TeX>A</TeX> and a target face <TeX>B</TeX>,
                  I can perform a series of rotations and reflections on the polyhedron so that <TeX>A</TeX> ends up where <TeX>B</TeX> used to be,
                  and the the polyhedron occpies the same region of space in both the starting and ending configurations.
                  <Citation source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isohedral_figure" />
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any polyhedron that is face transitive can be used as a fair die.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              It's <b>edge-transitive</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If I have a source edge <TeX>A</TeX> and a target edge <TeX>B</TeX>,
                  I can perform a series of rotations and reflections on the polyhedron so that <TeX>A</TeX> ends up where <TeX>B</TeX> used to be,
                  and the the polyhedron occpies the same region of space in both the starting and ending configurations.

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          However, it's also definitely not a Platonic solid:
          <ul className="mb-3">
            <li>It's not <b>vertex-transitive</b>. Some vertexes have 4 adjacent faces, and others have 6 adjacent faces.</li>
            <li>Its faces aren't regular polygons, they're rhombuses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We mentioned earlier that the 24-cell had 3D analogues, but that they were nonregular.
            One of those turns out to be the rhombic dodecahedron!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the rhombic dodecahedron isn't a Platonic solid, it's higher dimensional analogue is.
            Just like the rhombic dodecahedron, the 24-cell can be constructed by cutting up the 4-cube (or tesseract)
            into pyramidal pieces and turning them inside out.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        While it's not possible to use any other Platonic solid than a cube as a voxel,
        it's definitely possible to use one of the other space filling polyhedra as a voxel.
      </p>
      The main reason developers haven't done it yet is mostly due to reasons of convenience.
      Cubes are incredibly easy to work with:
      <ul>
        <li>The axes are orthogonal.</li>
        <li>You can represent the cube grid in a simple multi-dimensional array.</li>
        <li>The neighbors of each cube are easy to compute (just add or subtract one from one of the axes).</li>
        <li>Any point on the grid can be represented Cartesian coordinates.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Should I Use Noncubic Voxels?</h4>
      <p>
        Most likely not, unless you really want to for some reason.
        Noncubic voxels are kind of a pain.
