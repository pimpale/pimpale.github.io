The string is pushed onto the stack character by character, with a leading and terminating null byte. printstr is one of a few built in functions defined in src/functions.c ### comments Comments go from a `#` to the end of the line, and can be defined anywhere (even in a string). To include a literal `#` in the string, use a backslash ``` (hello # This is a comment world) println ``` This code would print out: ``` hello world ``` However, if we escape the hash, it would be: ``` (hello \\# This is a comment world) println ``` This results in ``` hello # This is a comment world ``` ### if statement ``` 1 ( # If (if the following condition is true, this will print) println ) ( # Else (if not, this will) println ) ifelse ``` The ifelse function takes 3 parameters, first a u8 number and two strings to be evaluated. The first string will be evaluated if the number is not equal to zero, and the second string will be evaluated if it was zero. Since strings can be nested, it\'s not a problem that we have another one inside. In this case, since the 1st parameter of ifelse is 1, the first string is evaluated. This pushes the string "if the following condition is true, this will print" to the stack and then prints it. There is also `eval` in addition to `ifelse` that evaluates unconditionally. ### math ``` 1 2 +u8 print8 ``` This program pushes the bytes 1 and 2, sums them, and prints the result. The order is left to right. For the most part, math is pretty self explanatory. Numeric literals must be less than 255. ### defining a function In order to define a new word, you\'ll have to use the mkfun function ``` ((hello) println) (say-hello) mkfun ``` Make sure that this file is in the current directory. The word definition is instantly available to you with no reload. Type ``` say-hello ``` within the interactive prompt. It should print out `hello world`. ### loops Loops loop forever as long as the value on the stack is not 0. They pop the value of the stack before executing the body. To print a word 10 times: ``` 10 ( (a word) println 1 -u8 dupu8 ) loop ``` Fizzbuzz: ``` 100 1 ( # loop # Although the loop counts down, we must count up dupu8 100 -u8 dupu8 3 %u8 0 ==u8 dupu8 5 %u8 0 ==u8 &&u8 #if ( (fizz buzz) println ) # Else ( dupu8 3 %u8 0 ==u8 #if ( (fizz) println ) # Else ( dupu8 5 %u8 0 ==u8 #if ( (buzz) println ) () ifelse ) ifelse ) ifelse dropu8 # Drop the 100 - version 1 -u8  # Subtract 1 from counter dupu8  # Make copy for loop to consume ) loop ``` ### Functions You can create functions that call code later. To create  a function, you can write ``` ((print) hello) (say-hello) mkfun ``` To call your new function, you can simply call it like any other function: ``` say-hello ``` This will say hello just as if you had typed in ``` (hello) print ```']})]})}),d=h(document.getElementById("root"));d.render(e(a.StrictMode,{children:e(u,{})}));
